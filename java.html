Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and built to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform in 1995. It is intended to allow application developers to write once, run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are usually compiled to a bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is identical to C and C++, but it has less low-level facilities than any of them. As of 2019, Java was one of GitHub's most popular programming languages, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers
