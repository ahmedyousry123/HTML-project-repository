C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes." Language has expanded greatly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to low-level memory manipulation capabilities. It's almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it's available on multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac OS, and various UNIX versions.
C++ was designed with a bias towards system programming and embedded, resource-restricted software and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found to be useful in many other ways, with the main strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers, and performance-critical applications.
