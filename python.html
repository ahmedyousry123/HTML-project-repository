Python
</div>

<div class="details">
Python is an interpretive, high-level, general-purpose programming language and a wonderful and powerful one that is easy to use (easy to read and write). Created by Guido van Rossum and first published in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes the readability of code with its impressive use of large whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large projects.
<br>Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. It supports various programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language because of its comprehensive standard library.
