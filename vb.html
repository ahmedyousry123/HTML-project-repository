<div class="details">
Visual Basic is Microsoft's third-generation event-driven programming language known for its Component Object Model (COM) programming model first released in 1991 and declared legacy in 2008. Visual Basic was developed by Microsoft to be fairly easy to learn and use. This evolved from the earlier version of DOS called BASIC. BASIC stands for Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. and enables rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) software, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.
<br>The programmer can create an application using the components provided by the Visual Basic program itself. Over time, the programming community has developed third-party components. Programs written in Visual Basic can also use the Windows API, which includes an additional feature declaration.
